<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Kimchi-jjigae or kimchi stew is made with kimchi and other ingredients.
  It is one of the most common stews in a Korean cuisine.
</p>
<p>
  Kimchi existed as a non-spicy pickled vegetable dish well prior to the Joseon era (1392â€“1897);
  it was not until the introduction of chili peppers to the Korean peninsula mid-era that the variant of kimchi which has become the de facto standard of today was created.
  Kimchi-jjigae is assumed to have developed around this time as well.
